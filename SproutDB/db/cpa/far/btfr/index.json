Financial statement users do not have the authority to prescribe the data they desire. Therefore, they must rely on external financial reporting to satisfy their information needs, and the objectives must be based on the needs of those users.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618315006919,"question":"According to the FASB conceptual framework, the relevance of providing information in financial statements is subject to the constraint of","answer":"Cost-benefit.","choices":["Comparability.","Reliability.","Faithful representation."],"explanation":"The FASB conceptual framework has identified the cost-benefit constraint to the relevance of providing financial reports.

Answer (Relevance, reliability, and faithful representation) is incorrect be- cause relevance and faithful representation are fundamental qualitative characteristics of financial information. Reliability is no longer listed as a fundamental quality. Answer (Cost-benefit and materiality) is incorrect because cost-benefit is a constraint, and materiality is a threshold for reporting useful information. Answer (Completeness, neutrality, and freedom from error) is incorrect because completeness, neutrality, and freedom from error are characteristics of faithful representation, a fundamental qualitative characteristic.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618315276494,"question":"According to Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts, neutrality is an ingredient of","answer":"Faithful Representation","choices":["Faithful Representation and Relevance","Relevance","None"],"explanation":"SFAC 8 defines neutrality as the quality of information which requires freedom from bias toward a predetermined result. Unbiased information would always be more faithfully represented than biased information. Other components of faithful representation include information to be verifiable and free from error. Neutrality is not an ingredient of relevance because relevance requires information to have predictive value and confirmatory value, or both.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618315331425,"question":"According to the FASB conceptual framework, which of the following is an enhancing quality that relates to both relevance and faithful representation?","answer":"Comparability.","choices":["Confirmatory value.","Predictive value.","Freedom from error."],"explanation":"Per SFAC 8, comparability is an enhancing quality of financial reporting which relates to both relevance and faithful representation.

Assuming the above is true, and no other estimate is better than the derived estimate, then the estimate is comprised of the best available information. Therefore, it is a faithful representation.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618361405060,"question":"What is the concept that supports the issuance of interim reports?","answer":"Relevance.","choices":["Materiality.","Consistency.","Faithful representation."],"explanation":"Relevant financial information is capable of making a difference if it has predictive value, confirmatory, value, or both. Predictive value requires information to be used to predict future outcomes. Confirmatory value requires that information either confirm or change prior expectations. An interim report provides both predictive value and confirmatory value because it provides a basis to forecast future earnings and it provides feed- back about prior performance expectations. Therefore, interim reporting is relevant.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618361497825,"question":"FASB’s conceptual framework explains both financial and physical capital maintenance concepts. Which capital maintenance concept is applied to currently reported net income, and which is applied to comprehensive income? Answer in (Currently Reported Net Income, Comprehensive Income)","answer":"Financial capital, Financial capital","choices":["Physical capital, Physical capital","Financial capital, Physical capital","Physical capital, Financial capital"],"explanation":"Per SFAC 6, the major difference between financial and physical capital maintenance is related to the effects of price changes on assets held and liabilities owed during a period. The financial capital concept is applied in current GAAP. Under this concept, the effects of the price changes described above are considered “holding gains and losses,” and are included in computing return on capital. Comprehensive income, which is described in SFAC 5, is “the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources.” It is also a measure of return on financial capital. The concept of physical capital maintenance seeks to measure the effects of price changes that are not currently captured under GAAP (e.g., replacement costs of non monetary assets). Under this concept, holding gains and losses are considered “capital maintenance adjustments” which would be included directly in equity and excluded from return on capital.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618361674876,"question":"According to the FASB conceptual framework, an entity’s revenue may result from","answer":"A decrease in a liability from primary operations.","choices":["An increase in an asset from incidental transactions.","An increase in a liability from incidental transactions.","A decrease in an asset from primary operations."],"explanation":"Per SFAC 6, revenues are inflows of assets or settlements of liabilities, or both, during a period as a result of an entity’s major or primary operations. Two essential characteristics of revenues are that revenues (1) arise from a company’s primary earnings activities and (2) are recurring or continuing in nature. Therefore, the answer is correct because it meets the above criteria. Answers (containing incidental transactions) are incorrect because they result from incidental transactions. Answer (A decrease in an asset from primary operations) is incorrect because a decrease of an asset is not a revenue.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618361703664,"question":"According to the FASB conceptual framework, which of the following is an essential characteristic of an asset?","answer":"An asset provides future benefits.","choices":["An asset is tangible.","An asset is obtained at a cost.","The claims to an asset’s benefits are legally enforceable."],"explanation":"Per SFAC 6, the common quality shared by all assets is “service potential” or “future economic benefit.” Per SFAC 6, assets commonly have other distinguishing features, such as being legally enforceable, tangible or acquired at a cost. These features, however, are not essential characteristics of assets.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618361769721,"question":"According to the FASB conceptual framework, which of the following attributes would not be used to measure inventory?","answer":"Present value of future cash flows.","choices":["Replacement cost.","Net realizable value.","Historical cost."],"explanation":"Per SFAC 5, five different attributes are used to measure assets and liabilities in present practice: historical cost, current (replacement) cost, current market value, net realizable value, and present value of future cash flows. Three of these (historical cost, replacement cost, and net realizable value) are used in measuring inventory at lower of cost or market. Present value of future cash flows is not used to measure inventory.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618361818551,"question":"According to SFAC7, Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements, the most relevant measurement of an entity’s liabilities at initial recognition and fresh-start measurements should always reflect","answer":"The credit standing of the entity.","choices":["Historical cost.","The expectations of the entity’s management.","The single most-likely minimum or maximum possible amount."],"explanation":"The most relevant measure of a liability always reflects the credit standing of the entity obligated to pay, according to SFAC 7.

FASB limited SFAC 7 to measurement issues (how to measure) and chose not to address recognition questions (when to measure). SFAC 7 introduces the expected cash flow approach, which differs from the traditional approach by focusing on explicit assumptions about the range of possible estimated cash flows and their respective probabilities.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618361901159,"question":"In calculating present value in a situation with a range of possible outcomes all discounted using the same interest rate, the expected present value would be","answer":"The sum of probability-weighted present values","choices":["The maximum outcome.","The minimum outcome.","The most-likely outcome."],"explanation":"The expected cash flow approach uses all expectations about possible cash flows in developing a measurement, rather than just the single most-likely cash flow. By incorporating a range of possible outcomes (with their respective timing differences), the expected cash flow approach accommodates the use of present value techniques when the timing of cash flows is uncertain. Thus, the expected cash flow is likely to provide a better estimate of fair value than the minimum, most-likely, or maxi- mum taken alone. According to SFAC 7, expected present value refers to the sum of probability-weighted present values in a range of estimated cash flows, all discounted using the same interest rate convention.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618361948714,"question":"A cash flow of $200,000 may be received by Lydia Nickels, Inc. in one year, two years, or three years, with probabilities of 20%, 50%, and 30%, respectively.

The objective of present value, when used in accounting measurements at initial recognition and fresh-start measurements, is to estimate fair value. Stated differently, present value should attempt to capture the elements that taken together would comprise a market price, if one existed, that is fair value. Value-in-use and entity-specific measurements attempt to capture the value of an asset or liability in the context of a particular entity. An entity-specific measurement substitutes the entity’s assumptions for those that marketplace participants would make.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618362061263,"question":"On December 31, year1, Brooks Co. decided to end operations and dispose of its assets within three months.

What is the appropriate measurement basis for equipment included in Brooks’ December 31, year 1 balance sheet?","answer":"Net realizable value.","choices":["Current reproduction cost.","Historical cost.","Current replacement cost."],"explanation":"The Codification provides guidance on the determination of gain or loss on disposal of a component of a business. According to this guidance, such determination should be based on estimates of the net realizable value of the component. Since Brooks Co. plans to discontinue its entire operations, the appropriate measurement basis for its equipment is net realizable value. Historical cost and current reproduction and replacement costs are not appropriate measurement bases for assets once an entity has decided to discontinue its operations because these amounts do not reflect the entity’s probable future benefit, which is a characteristic of assets per SFAC 6.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618362090302,"question":"Which of the following accounting literature is not included in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification?","answer":"Statements of Auditing Standards.","choices":["FASB Statements.","Accounting Research Bulletins.","AICPA Statements of Position."],"explanation":"The FASB Accounting Standards Codification includes all previous level A–D GAAP.

At that point the two criteria for revenue recognition were met; the revenue is (1) realized or realizable and (2) it is earned (SFAC 6).

Amar sells all of its cotton to Brye Co., which has agreed to purchase Amar’s entire production at the prevailing market price. Recent legislation assures that the market price will not fall below $.70 per pound during the next two years. Amar’s costs of selling and distributing the cotton are immaterial and can be reasonably estimated. Amar reports its inventory at expected exit value. During year 1, Amar sold and delivered to Brye 200,000 pounds at the market price of $.70. Amar sold the remaining 100,000 pounds during year 2 at the market price of $.72. What amount of revenue should Amar recognize in year 1?","answer":"$210,000","choices":["$144,000","$140,000","$216,000"],"explanation":"Income generally accrues only at the time of sale, and gains may not be anticipated by reflecting assets at their current sales prices. Exception to this general rule is granted, however, for agricultural products that are homogenous and have an immediate marketability at quoted prices such as the cotton in this problem (ASC 905-330-30-1). When these inventories are stated at sales prices, they should be reduced by expenditures to be incurred in disposal. Amar Farms should, therefore, recognize revenue on the entire 300,000 pound crop in year 1 at the guaranteed (and prevailing) market price of $.70 per pound. This amounts to $210,000 (300,000 pounds ! $.70 per pound = $210,000).

Since the sales promotional campaign is to be conducted in January, any associated costs are an expense of year 2. Thus, the $15,000 cost of printing catalogs should be removed from the advertising expense account and recorded as a prepaid expense as of 12/31/Y1. In addition, advertising expense must be increased by the $9,000 cost of December’s radio advertisements, which are an expense of year 1 even though they were not billed to Clark or paid until year 2. The $9,000 must be accrued as an expense and a liability at 12/31/Y1.

On 9/15/Y2, Wren received $17,000 in royalties for the first half of year 2. Royalties for the second half of year 2 will not be received until 3/15/Y3. However, the royalty payment to be received for the second six months (15% ! $60,000 = $9,000) has been earned and should be accrued at 12/31/Y2.

However, when the uncertainty of collection is so great that even the use of the installment method is precluded, then the cost recovery method may be used. Having no reasonable basis for estimating collecti- bility would provide a great enough uncertainty to use the cost recovery method. It is important to note that anytime the installment method is used, some risk of 100% collection exists, but the risk must be extreme before the cost recovery method is em- ployed.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618364559501,"question":"According to the cost recovery method of accounting, gross profit on an installment sale is recognized in income","answer":"After cash collections equal to the cost of sales have been received.","choices":["In proportion to the cash collections.","On the date the final cash collection is received.","On the date of sale."],"explanation":"Installment methods of recognizing revenue are appropriate only when “collection of the sale price is not reason- ably assured.” Under the cost recovery method, gross profit is deferred and recognized only when the cumulative receipts ex- ceed the cost of the asset sold.","image":"none"},{"hash":1618364628613,"question":"On December 31, year 1, Rice,Inc. authorized Graf to operate as a franchisee for an initial franchise fee of $150,000. Of this amount, $60,000 was received upon signing the agreement and the balance, represented by a note, is due in three annual payments of $30,000 each beginning December 31, year 2. The present value on December 31, year 1, of the three annual payments appropriately discounted is $72,000. According to the agreement, the nonrefundable down payment represents a fair measure of the services already performed by Rice; however, substantial future services are required of Rice.

Substantial performance means the franchiser has performed substantially all of required initial services and has no remaining obligation to refund any cash received. The $60,000 nonrefundable down payment applies to the initial services already performed by Rice. Therefore, the $60,000 may be recognized as revenue in year 1. The three remaining $30,000 installments relate to substantial future services to be performed by Rice.

Experience indicates that one franchisee will default on the additional payments. Services for the initial fee will be performed in year 2. What amount of net unearned franchise fees would Potter report at December 31, year 1?","answer":"$610,000","choices":["$600,000","$400,000","$630,000"],"explanation":"Initial franchise fees are not recognized as revenue until the franchisor makes substantial performance of the required services, and collection is reasonably assured. Since Potter Pie has not yet performed the required services, the initial franchise fee (21 ! $30,000 = $630,000) is reported as unearned franchise fees at 12/31/Y1. The estimated uncollectible amount ($20,000) normally would be recorded as a debit to bad debt expense and a credit to allowance for uncollectible accounts. However, since no revenue has yet been recognized, it is inappropriate to record bad debt expense. Instead, unearned franchise fees is debited, because an unearned revenue should not be recorded when, in effect, no related asset has been received. Therefore, the net unearned franchise fees is $610,000 ($630,000 – $20,000).","image":"none"},{"hash":1618364803646,"question":"In which of the following examples of real estate transactions would the seller not transfer the usual risks and rewards of ownership?\nI.

However, the fact that Esker’s receivable is subject to future sub- ordination precludes recognition of the profit in full. Instead, the cost recovery method must be used to account for the sale. The deposit method is to be used\n1. Until the sale is consummated, when all activities necessary for closing have been performed.\n2. If the buyer’s initial and continuing investments are not adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property and the seller is not reasonably assured of re- covering the cost of the property if the buyer defaults.\nThe problem states that the sale has been consummated and that Kame’s initial and continuing investments are adequate. Therefore, the deposit method will not be used to account for the sale. The reduced profit method is used only when the initial investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property but the continuing investments are not. The continuing investments must also meet certain additional requirements for the reduced profit method to be used. Since Kame’s continuing investments are adequate, the reduced profit method will not be used to account for the sale. The full accrual method may be used only if profit on the sale is determinable, the earning process is virtually complete, and all of the following:\n1. A sale is consummated.\n2. The buyer’s initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the\nproperty.\n3. The seller’s receivable is not subject to future sub-\nordination.\n4.
